 How many signals (non PWR or GND) are exchanged between the digital
controller and the PING sensor?
 What voltage levels does it expect for logic 0 and logic 1?
 How long a pulse must we send to initiate a sensing?
 How long do we need to wait before expecting a return signal?
 What range of time will the return
pulse last?
 How long do we need to wait
before starting our next sensing?

3. Input trigger: positive TTL pulse, 2 µs min, 5 µs typ
4. Echo pulse: positive TTL pulse, 115 µs minimum to 18.5 ms maximum.
